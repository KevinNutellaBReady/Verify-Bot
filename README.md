# Verify-Bot
 
Hey, 
To use this bot you need to setup this bot. 
You NEED to put your Token from the Discord "application" in the json file.
Did you have finish that ? yes ? Then you can change the Prefix (default: ":"), the Command (default: "verify"), the finished Message (default: "Okay, you have been verified. Please read our Rules, and have lot of fun on our Discord Server!"), or the Role (default: "Verified").

Please make Issue's if you see Bugs etc. 

In the future i will make more Projects :D

Thank you for using my Verify bot :) Have FUN ! :D
